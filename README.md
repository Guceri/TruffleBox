## Project Init

![](public/eth.png)

I created this project as a quicker starting point for solidity projects. It combines 3 major frameworks that are used together:
- React
- Truffle (including standard changes to truffle-config.js)
- MetaMask

Additionally, packages that are staples and used often throughout projects are also embedded:
- dotenv (.env file integration)
- web3
- chai
- lodash
- moment
- bootstrap
- babel (ES6 integration for Javascript)

## Instructions
1.  clone repository or download a local copy
2.  type npm install in the project directory to install package.json packages
3.  configure .env file (rename & set API keys, Mnemonics, etc.)
4.  make adjustments to truffle-config.js as needed
